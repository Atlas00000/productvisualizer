# **Development Commandments**

## **Core Principles**

1. **No Overengineering**  
   * Keep solutions simple and straightforward  
   * Avoid unnecessary abstractions  
   * Use the simplest solution that works  
   * Don't add features "just in case"  
   * Avoid premature optimization  
   * Don't solve problems that don't exist  
2. **Stay Within Scope**  
   * Only implement features specified in requirements  
   * No out-of-scope features unless critical for bug fixes  
   * Focus on core functionality first  
   * Document any scope changes  
   * Reject scope creep  
   * Keep feature requests in a backlog  
3. **Avoid Overcomplexity**  
   * Keep code readable and maintainable  
   * Use familiar patterns and solutions  
   * Avoid complex algorithms unless necessary  
   * Document complex decisions  
   * Prefer explicit over implicit  
   * Avoid "clever" code  
4. **Modular Approach**  
   * Write modular, reusable code  
   * Follow single responsibility principle  
   * Keep components loosely coupled  
   * Make testing easier through modularity  
   * Use dependency injection  
   * Keep modules small and focused  
5. **Keep It Simple**  
   * Use straightforward solutions  
   * Avoid premature optimization  
   * Write clear, self-documenting code  
   * Focus on maintainability  
   * Use standard libraries when possible  
   * Avoid custom implementations of standard features

## **Database Management**

1. **Database Changes**  
   * Always restart containers after database changes  
   * Run migrations after schema updates  
   * Never modify production database directly  
   * Keep migrations simple and atomic  
   * Document all schema changes  
   * Version control all migrations  

2. **Development Workflow**  
   * Use Docker for consistent environments  
   * Run migrations in development first  
   * Test migrations before committing  
   * Keep database credentials secure  
   * Use environment variables for configuration  
   * Document database setup steps  

3. **Migration Process**  
   * Stop running containers: `docker-compose down`  
   * Rebuild containers: `docker-compose up --build`  
   * Run migrations: `PGPASSWORD=postgres docker-compose exec app psql -h postgres -U postgres -d budgeting -f src/config/database.sql`  
   * Verify database state  
   * Document any issues encountered  

4. **Best Practices**  
   * Keep migrations idempotent when possible  
   * Use transactions for data safety  
   * Back up data before migrations  
   * Test migrations with sample data  
   * Document rollback procedures  
   * Keep schema changes minimal  

## **Development Rules**

1. **Package Management**  
   * Always use pnpm over npm when possible  
   * Leverage pnpm's better dependency resolution  
   * Take advantage of pnpm's disk space efficiency  
   * Use pnpm's stricter version control  
   * Maintain consistent package management across the team  
   * Document package management decisions  
2. **Code Organization**  
   * Follow project structure guidelines  
   * Keep related code together  
   * Use consistent naming conventions  
   * Maintain clear file organization  
   * Group by feature, not by type  
   * Keep configuration separate from code  
3. **Testing**  
   * Write tests for new features  
   * Keep tests simple and focused  
   * Test core functionality first  
   * Document test cases  
   * Test behavior, not implementation  
   * Use meaningful test descriptions  
4. **Documentation**  
   * Document important decisions  
   * Keep README up to date  
   * Comment complex logic  
   * Document API changes  
   * Include examples in documentation  
   * Document known limitations  
5. **Version Control**  
   * Write clear commit messages  
   * Keep commits focused  
   * Follow branching strategy  
   * Review changes before committing  
   * Use meaningful branch names  
   * Keep commit history clean  
6. **Code Review**  
   * Review for simplicity  
   * Check for scope compliance  
   * Verify modularity  
   * Ensure documentation  
   * Look for potential bugs  
   * Check for security issues

## **When Adding Features**

1. **Ask These Questions**  
   * Is this within scope?  
   * Is this the simplest solution?  
   * Can this be modularized?  
   * Is this necessary?  
   * Does this add value?  
   * Can this be tested?  
2. **Documentation Requirements**  
   * Document the feature  
   * Explain the implementation  
   * Note any trade-offs  
   * Update relevant docs  
   * Include usage examples  
   * Document edge cases  
3. **Testing Requirements**  
   * Write unit tests  
   * Test edge cases  
   * Verify functionality  
   * Document test cases  
   * Test error conditions  
   * Verify performance impact

## **When Fixing Bugs**

1. **Investigation**  
   * Reproduce the issue  
   * Identify root cause  
   * Consider simplest fix  
   * Document the problem  
   * Check for similar issues  
   * Verify the fix works  
2. **Implementation**  
   * Fix the core issue  
   * Add necessary tests
