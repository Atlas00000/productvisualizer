   - Create `README.md` with project overview

2. **Initialize version control**
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Create initial commit with folder structure

3. **Set up development environment**
   - Install Node.js (if not already installed)
   - Install pnpm (preferred package manager)
   - Verify development tools are working

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Project folders created
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Development tools verified
- [ ] Basic README written

## **Quick Win 2: Basic HTML Structure (P1)**

### **Objective**
Create simple HTML page with CDN imports for React, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS.

### **Steps**
1. **Create main HTML file**
   - Create `frontend/index.html`
   - Add basic HTML5 structure
   - Include meta tags for responsive design

2. **Add CDN imports**
   - Import React from CDN
   - Import Three.js from CDN
   - Import Tailwind CSS from CDN
   - Import OrbitControls for camera

3. **Create basic layout**
   - Add container for 3D viewer
   - Add container for customization panel
   - Add container for product details
   - Use Tailwind classes for basic styling

4. **Create JavaScript structure**
   - Create `frontend/js/app.js` for main application
   - Create `frontend/js/config/constants.js` for configuration
   - Set up basic module structure

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] HTML page loads without errors
- [ ] CDN imports working
- [ ] Basic layout visible
- [ ] JavaScript files created

## **Quick Win 3: Express Server (P1)**

### **Objective**
Set up basic API server with essential endpoints.

### **Steps**
1. **Initialize backend project**
   - Navigate to `backend/` directory
   - Run `pnpm init` to create package.json
   - Install Express, CORS, dotenv, mongoose, JWT

2. **Create server structure**
   - Create `backend/server.js` as main entry point
   - Create `backend/config/` directory
   - Create `backend/routes/` directory
   - Create `backend/models/` directory

3. **Set up basic Express server**
   - Configure Express with middleware (CORS, JSON parsing)
   - Set up basic error handling
   - Create health check endpoint (`GET /health`)

4. **Create basic routes**
   - Create `backend/routes/products.js` for product endpoints
   - Create `backend/routes/customizations.js` for customization endpoints
   - Set up route handlers with placeholder responses

5. **Configure environment**
   - Create `.env` file for environment variables
   - Set up PORT, MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET variables
   - Create `.env.example` for documentation

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Express server starts without errors
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds
- [ ] Basic routes are accessible
- [ ] Environment variables configured

## **Quick Win 4: MongoDB Connection (P1)**

### **Objective**
Establish database connectivity with basic schema setup.

### **Steps**
1. **Set up MongoDB Atlas**
   - Create free MongoDB Atlas account
   - Create new cluster
   - Configure network access (allow all IPs for development)
   - Create database user with read/write permissions

2. **Configure database connection**
   - Create `backend/config/database.js`
   - Set up Mongoose connection with error handling
   - Add connection status logging
   - Configure connection options (timeout, retry)

3. **Create basic schemas**
   - Create `backend/models/Product.js` with basic product schema
   - Create `backend/models/Customization.js` with basic customization schema
   - Define simple fields (name, price, options)
   - Add basic validation rules

4. **Test database connectivity**
   - Create test endpoint to verify connection
   - Test basic CRUD operations
   - Verify error handling for connection issues

5. **Add sample data**
   - Create `data/products.json` with sample product data
   - Create script to seed database with sample data
   - Verify data can be retrieved via API

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas cluster created
- [ ] Database connection established
- [ ] Basic schemas defined
- [ ] Sample data loaded
- [ ] API can retrieve data

## **Development Workflow for Week 1**

### **Daily Tasks**
1. **Morning**: Review progress, check for blockers
2. **Development**: Focus on one quick win at a time
3. **Testing**: Test each component before moving on
4. **Documentation**: Update README with setup instructions

### **Quality Checks**
- [ ] Code follows development commandments
- [ ] No overengineering detected
- [ ] Modular structure maintained
- [ ] Simple solutions implemented
- [ ] Documentation updated

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
- **Overengineering**: Don't add complex features yet
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to basic setup only
- **Complex Configuration**: Keep it simple
- **Premature Optimization**: Focus on functionality first
